# A number of scripts/utilities for an End to End CDE workflow

These are scripts/utilities that I've written over the years to make extraction, labelling, and evaluation much easier in CDE. Put this e2e_workflow somewhere in your Python path  (TODO: make this a package), and run the scripts. Where customisation is required, there are examples in the examples folder.

## Labelling a gold standard corpus

## Extracting

### At home

### On ALCF

## Evaluating your results
